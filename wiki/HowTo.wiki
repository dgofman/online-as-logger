= Run AS Logger online =

Open the browser window, in the Address bar enter this URL:
http://online-as-logger.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demo/Logger.html

If you want to open AS Logger in the new window copy paste this Javascript:

{{{
javascript:(function(){var o=window.open('http://online-as-logger.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demo/Logger.html', 'logger','width=750,height=450,resizable=1')})()
}}}

You can also add this URL for your convenience into browser's Bookmarks (Mozilla Firefox) or Favorites (Internet Explorer).

_Note:_ You have to disable Pop-up blocker at this time or allow this site-script for opening in pop-up window.

= Use AS Logger in MXML file =

Copy Logger.as file into your project source root. 
Now in your MXML file you can use Logger class from any place.

 Example:
{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<mx:Application xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml" 
	applicationComplete="Logger.debug('Application initialzed')">
</mx:Application>
}}}

= Use AS Logger in HTML file =

After HTML body declaration, please add Javascript tag to enable _AS Logger_ access from HTML page.

{{{
<BODY>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://online-as-logger.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demo/Logger.js"></script>

…
<BODY>
}}}
Now add these lines for testing Javascript to _AS Logger_ communication. Before running your HTML file, don’t forget to open _AS Logger_ panel to view your outputs.
{{{
<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript">
	setInterval(function(){Logger.info(new Date())}, 1000);
</SCRIPT> 
}}}

= View output using third party components =

  * You can view logs in Mozilla Firefox Console, but before that you need to install Firebug Add-on [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843]

  * Another tool that I am using on Windows OS is Xpanel [http://www.docsultant.com/site2/articles/flex_xpanel.html]. 

  * You can use Thunder-Bolt as well [http://code.google.com/p/flash-thunderbolt/]
